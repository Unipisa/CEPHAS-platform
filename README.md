# CEPHAS Platform Orchestrator

This repository contains the code related to the Orchestrator for the edge platform originally developed during the master thesis in Computer Engineering of Lorenzo Giorgi @University of Pisa.
This software is responsible for creating all software infrastructure for the edge platform at startup, receiving login/logout request from client and migration request from Mobility Management.
All those requests triggers modification in resource allocated on Edge nodes, both in terms of Docker container executing client related application and Envoy rules installed on Edge Envoy proxies.

**Note:** TLS/mTLS certificates and private keys not included for security reasons. See Security/TLS section.

## Security/TLS
Both Envoy and Docker uses mTLS to provide encryption and authentication.

Docker server side cert/key must be manually installed on the target edge node, see [Protect Docker daemon socket](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#use-tls-https-to-protect-the-docker-daemon-socket).
Client cert/key must be placed inside **resouces/docker-client-certificate with names ca.pem, cert.pem, and key.pem**.

Envoy server side mTLS resouces must be placed inside **resouces/mTLS-Envoy-server with names ca.pem, cert.pem, and key.pem**, 
while client's inside **resources/tls/envoy-mtls**, according to the file tree structure. 

TLS cert and key used during experiment were CA-signed certificate (by [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). In order to use this software, you have to provide 
valid TLS resources for your domain (that you have configure into configuration file). Since a single cert/key is used for
all subdomain, I suggest to use a wildcard certificate with all necessary Subject Alternative Name ([SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name)).
In order to work properly, the certificate must contain the following domain:
Name between quote marks indicates variable to be set in **configuration.json** file.
- "PLATFORM_ORCHESTRATOR_DOMAIN" 
- "PLATFORM_ENVOY_CONF_SERVER_DOMAIN"  
- "PLATFORM_CLOUD_DOMAIN" 
- *."PLATFORM_NODE_BASE_DOMAIN"
- *."PLATFORM_NODE_BASE_DOMAIN" - only necessary if you want DNS mode

Orchestrator API are server using HTTPS. To make them work correctly, you need to create a valid keystone for your Orchestrator domain
using the previously generated certificate/key as reported [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/906402/how-to-import-an-existing-x-509-certificate-and-private-key-in-java-keystore-to).

## DNS

In this thesis work, PowerDNS DNS Server has been used to dynamically setup A record for edge proxies and Orchestrator. 
However, it is possible to test the code even without it, simply settings DNS record manually. 
The following table describe the records to add to your DNS server in order to use the platform:
Name between quote marks indicates variable to be set in **configuration.json** file.

| Record Type | Domain                              | IP address                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A           | "PLATFORM_ORCHESTRATOR_DOMAIN"      | "ORCHESTRATOR_API_IP"            | DNS record that points to the node on which the Orchestrator is running                                                                                                                                   |
| A           | "PLATFORM_ENVOY_CONF_SERVER_DOMAIN" | "ENVOY_CONFIGURATION_SERVER_IP"  | DNS record that points to the node on which the Orchestrator is running.<br/> This is a different DNS record because in a different implementation Orchestrator and Envoy control plane may be separated. |
| A           | "PLATFORM_CLOUD_DOMAIN"             | "cloudNode"."ipAddress"          | DNS record that points to node on which the cloud Envoy instance is running.                                                                                                                              |
| A           | "nodeId"."PLATFORM_NODE_BASE_DOMAIN" | "edgeNodes"."<nodeId>"."ipAddress" | DNS record that points to each edge node of platform                                                                                                                                                      |

If you want to use also the Orchestrator in DNS mode, you need to setup [PowerDNS Authoritative Server](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/index.html).
The configuration file `pdns.conf` used during our test is inside `powerdns_configuration` folder. 

You need to create a zone for your "PLATFORM_DOMAIN", using the [REST API](https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/http-api/zone.html).
A dump of the zone configuration used is available under `powerdns_configuration/zone_config.json`.

When PowerDNS is correctly configured, you need to put into Orchestrator configuration file the following information:
- DNS_API_IP
- DNS_API_PORT
- DNS_API_SERVER_ID
- DNS_API_KEY
Please refer to [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for explanation of all parameters.
